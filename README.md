# My personal project 

Implementation GAN model for Handbag Design


## Dataset 

- I collected 2,000 handbag photos from the Internet and used them as Train dataset

## Gan model 
- I tried to make my own model by referring to the existing LSGAN for handbag design
- The goal is to create my own new GAN model regardless of the result of creation
- I hope that someone who visits my page can further develop my model and get better results

## Train : face detection

- You just have to run a DesignGan.ipynb or DesignGan.py
